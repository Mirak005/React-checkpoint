Instruction :

Let’s start to play around with React.

1. Create a new React project
2. Try to recreate the form you built in the first checkpoint
3. Add bootstrap to your project
4. In case you have any problem, take a look at the React documentation
5. Be creative! By creating a layout for the website

NB :
-Watch out for jsx rules :
1-className not class (there is also other attributes camelCase )
2-self closing tags must be closed with a "/" like this ( <input /> , <br/> , <img/> , ... )
