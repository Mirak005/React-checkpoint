Instruction :


Letâ€™s start to play around with React.

1. Create a new React project
2. Try to recreate the form you built in the first checkpoint
3. Add bootstrap to your project
4. In case you have any problem, take a look at the React documentation
5. Be creative! By creating a layout for the website

Guide Line

NB : -Watch out for jsx rules :

              1. className not class (there is also other attributes camelCase ) 
              
              2. self closing tags must be closed with a "/" like this ( <input /> , <br/> , <img/> , ... ) 
              
     -You can import bootstrap using the stylesheet link in public/index.html
